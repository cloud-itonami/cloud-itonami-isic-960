  "Integration tests for `personalcareops.operation/build` -- builds the
  REAL compiled `langgraph.graph` StateGraph and runs it end-to-end via
  `langgraph.graph/run*` through commit / hard-hold / phase-hold /
  escalate-approve / escalate-reject routes.

  This namespace is genuinely falsifiable: every `is` here would fail if
  the graph regressed to the old hand-rolled pipeline behavior (e.g. if
  `:decide` could never reach `:commit` again, or if a HARD governor
  violation were ever routed through human approval instead of straight
  to `:hold`, or if the ledger were written before a commit/hold actually
  happened)."
